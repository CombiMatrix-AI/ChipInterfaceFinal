# CMAI Chip Interface Software

Software to control CMAI chip and apply voltages. Working on Windows 11 with AdLink PCIe-9101 card and Keithley 6485. 

## Notes:

- Run tester.exe to run program
- If Keithley is using older GPIB-USB-B cable, NI-488.2 drivers must be on older 17.6 version. Try to use newer GPIB-USB-HS cable.
